# Purpose

is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.

In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.

Because it can handle a high volume of connections, NGINX is commonly used as a reverse proxy and [load balancer](https://www.nginx.com/blog/five-reasons-use-software-load-balancer/) to manage incoming traffic and distribute it to slower upstream servers â€“ anything from legacy database servers to microservices.

Dynamic sites, built using anything from Node.js to PHP, commonly deploy NGINX as a content cache and reverse proxy to reduce load on application servers and make the [most effective use](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-and-nginx-plus-everywhere/) of the underlying hardware.
